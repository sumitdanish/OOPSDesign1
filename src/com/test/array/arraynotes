Segemt tree :
    Space complexity O(N)
    Time complexity to buid the tree is O(N)
    Query Time is O(logn)

 To find the result in given index range there are three rule to search the element in given index range
    1. Partial overlap(if interval of the node which is build in the tree is not inside) ->
    if given index range is partial overlap then we have to search the element
        in both the side of the tree
    2. Complete overlap (if interval of the node which is build in the tree is inside with equality)->
     if given index range if fully overlapped with any index range in the tree
        then we will stop the searching  the element and return the result
    3. No-Overlap -> same as complete overlaped
